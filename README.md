## About me

👩‍🎓 I have a background in Architecture Design and I am working as a software developer after completing a full-stack software development BootCamp at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) in 2024. I've gained my fundamental level ISTQB certificate and Microsoft Azure Fundamental Certificate. 
<br>
I am interested in coding because I like its approach to solving problems. When I'm not working, I like cooking, DIY and crocheting, going to the local community garden to learn some gardening knowledge, and taking care of my vegetables on my balcony.
<br><br><br>
⏺️ I am documenting my code-learning journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/siyuduan2023).<br>
✍🏼 I also write articles on Medium about my bootcamp experience and projects:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[How teamwork helped me survive Bootcamp Week 4 — — build a RESTful API](https://medium.com/@siyuduan.learning/how-teamwork-helped-me-survive-bootcamp-week-4-build-a-restful-api-a6e02ded886a)
<br><br><br>
 
📚 I am currently learning: <br> 
1) Java and automation testing.<br>
2) Angular and C# (with Microsoft course).<br>
3) Harvard CS50. <br>

📖 I created this [Trello](https://trello.com/b/2wGRCDqP/full-stack-development-learning) board to track my learning.<br>
🥳 I love practising JavaScript on exercise. I also like solving [CodeWar](https://www.codewars.com/users/CU_2023) katas <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/CU_2023/badges/micro?theme=light" alt="kata logo">, some kata solutions can be found in the following Pinned - CodeWar repo.

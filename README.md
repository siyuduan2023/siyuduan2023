## About me

üë©‚Äçüéì I recently graduated with an Architecture Design degree and am currently studying full-stack software development at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/). I am interested in coding because I like its approach to solving problems. When I'm not working, I like cooking, DIY and crocheting, going to the local community garden to learn some gardening knowledge, and taking care of my vegetables on my balcony.
<br><br><br>
‚è∫Ô∏è I am documenting my code-learning journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/siyuduan2023).<br>
‚úçüèº I also write articles on Medium about my bootcamp experience and projects:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[How teamwork helped me survive Bootcamp Week 4 ‚Äî ‚Äî build a RESTful API](https://medium.com/@siyuduan.learning/how-teamwork-helped-me-survive-bootcamp-week-4-build-a-restful-api-a6e02ded886a)
<br><br><br>
 
<!--I am currently learning UX Design with this course: [UI / UX Design Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ui-ux-design).--> 
üìñ I created this [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/devlearnboard/ATTIc0f396a626c55d043631a71a4e28378aA2FE8573) board to track my learning.<br>
ü•≥ I love practising JavaScript on exercise. I also like solving [CodeWar](https://www.codewars.com/users/CU_2023) katas <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/CU_2023/badges/micro?theme=light" alt="kata logo">, some kata solutions can be found in the following Pinned - CodeWar repo.

I am interested in coding because I like its approach to solving problems. When I'm not working, I like cooking, DIY and crocheting, going to the local community garden to learn some gardening knowledge, and taking care of my vegetables on my balcony.
🥳 I love practising JavaScript on exercise. I also like solving [CodeWar](https://www.codewars.com/users/CU_2023) katas <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/CU_2023/badges/micro?theme=light" alt="kata logo">, some kata solutions can be found in the following Pinned - CodeWar repo.

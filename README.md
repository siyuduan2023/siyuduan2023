## About me

üë©‚Äçüéì I have a background in Architecture Design and I am working as a frontend developer after completing a full-stack software development BootCamp in 2024. I've gained my fundamental level ISTQB certificate (Mar 2024), Microsoft Azure Fundamental Certificate (Sep 2024) and Microsoft Azure AI Fundamental Certificate (Oct 2024). 
<br>
I am interested in coding because I like its approach to solving problems. When I'm not working, I like cooking, DIY and crocheting, going to the local community garden to learn some gardening knowledge, and taking care of my vegetables on my balcony.
<br><br><br>
‚è∫Ô∏è I am documenting my code-learning journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/siyuduan2023).<br>
‚úçüèº I also write articles on Medium about my learning experiences and projects:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[How teamwork helped me survive Bootcamp Week 4 ‚Äî ‚Äî build a RESTful API](https://medium.com/@siyuduan.learning/how-teamwork-helped-me-survive-bootcamp-week-4-build-a-restful-api-a6e02ded886a)
<br><br><br>
 
üìö I am currently learning:
1) Angular Certificate: Junior Level<br>
2) C# (with Microsoft course).<br>
3) Prompt Engineering <br>

üìñ I created this [Trello](https://trello.com/b/2wGRCDqP/full-stack-development-learning) board to track my learning.<br>
ü•≥ I love practising JavaScript on exercise. I also like solving [CodeWar](https://www.codewars.com/users/CU_2023) katas <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/CU_2023/badges/micro?theme=light" alt="kata logo">, some kata solutions can be found in the following Pinned - CodeWar repo.
